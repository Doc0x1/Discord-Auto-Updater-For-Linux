# Discord Auto Updater For Linux
A big thanks to @pentestfunctions for giving me the idea to make this, once I started looking into how to do it, it ended up being a pretty trivial task to complete.

## How It Works
This tool makes use of the System Daemon (Systemd) to automatically set up and update Discord for you. (Currently a WIP NOT READY FOR USE)
